-- |Put a value into an 'MVar'.  If the 'MVar' is currently full,
-- 'putMVar' will wait until it becomes empty.
--
-- There are two further important properties of 'putMVar':
--
--   * 'putMVar' is single-wakeup.  That is, if there are multiple
--     threads blocked in 'putMVar', and the 'MVar' becomes empty,
--     only one thread will be woken up.  The runtime guarantees that
--     the woken thread completes its 'putMVar' operation.
--
--   * When multiple threads are blocked on an 'MVar', they are
--     woken up in FIFO order.  This is useful for providing
--     fairness properties of abstractions built using 'MVar's.

{-|
  Take a value from an 'MVar', put a new value into the 'MVar' and
  return the value taken. Note that there is a race condition whereby
  another process can put something in the 'MVar' after the take
  happens but before the put does.
